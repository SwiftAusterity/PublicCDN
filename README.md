What goes in my public CDN. Might be APIs, might be weird javascript things

# mcgWebRing

This is a WebRing, yeah like from the 90s. It's ugly and it stands out purposefully. To gain admission to the webring you'll need an entry in the .json file and that's about it.

You MUST be a member of the MUD Coders Guild to be included in the webring.

Adding the webring is super easy. Just include the webring .js file at the bottom of your webpage and have a ```<div>``` tag somewhere that has an id of guildWebRing like so: ```<div id="guildWebRing" style="width: 100%; padding-left: 40%;" />```
